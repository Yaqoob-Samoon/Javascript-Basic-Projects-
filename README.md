# JavaScript Basic Projects 🚀

This repository contains a collection of fun and beginner-friendly JavaScript projects I built while learning core web development concepts like **DOM manipulation**, **event handling**, **game logic**, and **animations**.

Each project is self-contained and written using **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript** — no frameworks or libraries.

## 📚 What I Learned

Through these projects, I practiced and improved:
- JavaScript fundamentals (variables, functions, loops, arrays, etc.)
- DOM selection and manipulation
- Handling user input and events
- Timing functions (`setInterval`, `setTimeout`)
- Creating animations and interactive elements
- Game development logic
